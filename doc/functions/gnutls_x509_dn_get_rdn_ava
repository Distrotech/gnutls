@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_dn_get_rdn_ava} (gnutls_x509_dn_t @var{dn}, int @var{irdn}, int @var{iava}, gnutls_x509_ava_st * @var{ava})
@var{dn}: a pointer to DN

@var{irdn}: index of RDN

@var{iava}: index of AVA.

@var{ava}: Pointer to structure which will hold output information.

Get pointers to data within the DN. The format of the  @code{ava} structure
is shown below.

struct gnutls_x509_ava_st @{
gnutls_datum_t oid;
gnutls_datum_t value;
unsigned long value_tag;
@};

The X.509 distinguished name is a sequence of sequences of strings
and this is what the  @code{irdn} and  @code{iava} indexes model.

Note that  @code{ava} will contain pointers into the  @code{dn} structure, so you
should not modify any data or deallocate it.  Note also that the DN
in turn points into the original certificate structure, and thus
you may not deallocate the certificate and continue to access  @code{dn} .

@strong{Returns:} Returns 0 on success, or an error code.
