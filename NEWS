Version 0.2.90 (7/12/2001)
- gnutls_handshake(), gnutls_read() etc. functions no longer require
  the 'SOCKET cd' argument. This argument is set using the function
  gnutls_set_transport_ptr().

  a list containing peer's certificate and issuers DER encoded.

Version 0.2.11 (16/11/2001)
- Changed the meaning of GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE value. If this value
  is returned, then the caller should perform a handshake or send
  an alert to the peer.

  it occupies less space.
