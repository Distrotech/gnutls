    <td>SSL 3.0 vulnerability (POODLE)</td>
    <td>This is a vulnerability on the SSL 3.0 protocol, which can be
    exploited when TLS clients use a non-standard insecure protocol
    negotiation (it affects mostly browsers). Clients performing the
    standard TLS handshake as documented by GnuTLS are not affected.<br>

	Analysis by Nikos</a><br>

      <b>Recommendation:</b> For clients using the documented
handshake process no action is required. Clients that use the non-standard insecure
negotiation should not negotiate SSL 3.0. In all cases it recommended
to disable SSL 3.0 using a priority string such as "NORMAL:-VERS-SSL3.0".</td>
