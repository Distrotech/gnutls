      </td>
    <td>Denial of service</td>
    <td>Sean Burford reported that the encoding of elliptic curves parameters
    GnuTLS 3 is vulnerable to a denial of service (heap
    corruption). It affects clients and servers which print information about
    the peer's certificate, e.g., the key ID, and can be exploited via
    a specially crafted X.509 certificate.<br>

      <b>Recommendation:</b> Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.3.10, 3.2.20 or 3.1.28.</td>
