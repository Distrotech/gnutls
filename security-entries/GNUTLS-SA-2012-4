      </td>
    <td>Possible plaintext recovery</td>
    <td><p>There is an attack on TLS called "CRIME" which
takes advantage of compression and may recover plaintext under certain
circumstances.</p>
<p>
<b>Who is affected by this attack?</b>
<ul>
<li>Clients or servers that use compression and provide the ability to
an adversary to inject data (multiple times) in their session.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
<b>How to mitigate the attack?</b>
<ul>
<li>Do not enable compression (GnuTLS doesn't enable it by default)</li>
<li>When using compression use the CBC ciphers that include a random
padding up to 255 bytes. That would increase the number of trials an
attacker needs to perform significantly.</li>
</ul>
</p>
Note that using compression provides <a href="https://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/ecrypt/provpriv2012/abstracts/barghavan.pdf">information to an attacker</a> on the plaintext.
