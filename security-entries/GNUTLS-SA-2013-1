	TLS CBC padding timing attack</a><br>

	CVE-2013-1619</a>
      </td>
    <td>Possible plaintext recovery</td>
    <td><p>
Nadhem Alfardan and Kenny Paterson devised an attack that recovers
some bits of the plaintext of a GnuTLS session that utilizes that CBC 
ciphersuites, by using timing information.
</p>
<p>
In order for the attack to work the client must operate as follows. 
It connects to a server, it sends some (encrypted) data that will be 
intercepted by the attacker, who will terminate the client's connection 
abnormally (i.e. the client will receive a premature termination error). 
The client should repeat that, multiple times.
</p>
<p>
<b>Who is affected by this attack?</b>
<ul>
<li>Clients that repeatedly reconnect and transfer the same data, after 
a TLS fatal error occurs.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
<b>How to mitigate the attack?</b>
<ul>
<li>Do not enable the CBC ciphersuites, prefer ARCFOUR or GCM modes.</li>
<li>Upgrade to the latest GnuTLS version (3.1.7, 3.0.28, or 2.12.23).</li>
</ul>
