GnuTLS is a GNU project.  Additional\r\ninformation can be found at <http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/>\r\nand <http://www.gnutls.org/>.\r\n\r\n\r\nREADME\r\n------\r\nThis README is targeted for users of the library who build from\r\nsources but do not necessarily develop.  If you are interested\r\nin developing and contributing to the GnuTLS project, please\r\nsee README-alpha and visit\r\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/manual/html_node/Contributing.html.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPILATION\r\n-----------\r\nA typical command sequence for building the library is shown below.\r\nA complete list of options available for configure can be found\r\nby running './configure --help'.\r\n\r\n    cd gnutls-<version>\r\n    ./configure --prefix=/usr\r\n    make\r\n    sudo make install\r\n\r\nThe commands above build and install the static archive (libgnutls.a),\r\nthe shared object (libgnutls.so), and additional binaries such as certtool \r\nand gnutls-cli.\r\n\r\nThe library depends on libnettle. Optionally it may use the \r\nfollowing libraries:\r\n * p11-kit: for smart card support\r\n     http://p11-glue.freedesktop.org/p11-kit.html\r\n * libtspi: for Trusted Platform Module (TPM) support, \r\n     http://trousers.sourceforge.net/\r\n * libunbound: For DNSSEC/DANE support,\r\n     http://unbound.net/\r\n * libz: For compression support.\r\n     http://www.zlib.net/\r\n * libtasn1: For ASN.1 parsing (a copy is included, if not found)\r\n     http://www.gnu.org/software/libtasn1/\r\n\r\nVersions 2.10.3 and prior used libgcrypt as the default cryptographic library.\r\nNettle can be found at http://www.gnu.org/software/nettle/, while\r\np11-kit can be found at <http://p11-glue.freedesktop.org/p11-kit.html>.\r\n\r\nTo configure libnettle for installation and use by GnuTLS, a typical\r\ncommand sequence would be:\r\n\r\n    cd nettle-<version>\r\n    ./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-openssl --enable-shared\r\n    make\r\n    sudo make install\r\n\r\nFor the Nettle project, --enable-shared will instruct automake and\r\nfriends to build and install both the static archive (libnettle.a)\r\nand the shared object (libnettle.so).\r\n\r\nIn case you are compiling for an embedded system, you can disable\r\nunneeded features of GnuTLS.  In general, it is usually best not to\r\ndisable anything (for future mailing list questions and possible bugs).\r\n\r\nDepending on your installation, additional libraries, such as libtasn1\r\nand zlib, may be required.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCUMENTATION\r\n-------------\r\nSee the documentation in doc/ and online at\r\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/manual.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\n--------\r\nSee the examples in doc/examples/ and online at 'How To Use GnuTLS in\r\nApplications' at http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/manual.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECURITY ADVISORIES\r\n-------------------\r\nThe project collects and publishes information on past security\r\nincidents and vulnerabilities.  Open information exchange, including\r\ninformation which is [sometimes] suppressed in non-open or non-free\r\nprojects, is one of the goals of the GnuTLS project.  Please visit\r\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/security.html.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAILING LISTS\r\n-------------\r\nThe GnuTLS project maintains mailing lists for users, developers, and\r\ncommits.  Please see http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/lists.html.\r\n\r\n\r\nLICENSING\r\n---------\r\nSince GnuTLS version 3.0.0, the core library has been released under\r\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 3 or later.\r\n\r\nThe GNU LGPL applies to the main GnuTLS library, while the\r\nincluded applications as well as gnutls-openssl \r\nlibrary are under the GNU GPL version 3.  The gnutls library is \r\nlocated in the lib/ directory, while the applications in src/ and\r\ngnutls-openssl library is at extra/.\r\n\r\nFor any copyright year range specified as YYYY-ZZZZ in this package\r\nnote that the range specifies every single year in that closed interval.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUGS\r\n----\r\nThorough testing is very important and expensive.  Often, the \r\ndevelopers do not have access to a particular piece of hardware or \r\nconfiguration to reproduce a scenario.  Notifying the developers about a \r\npossible bug will greatly help the project.  \r\n\r\nIf you believe you have found a bug, please report it to bug-gnutls@gnu.org\r\ntogether with any applicable information.  A web interface for the system\r\nis available at http://savannah.gnu.org/support/?group=gnutls.\r\n\r\nApplicable information would include why the issue is a GnuTLS bug (if\r\nnot readily apparent), output from 'uname -a', the version of the library or\r\ntool being used, a stack trace if available ('bt full' if under gdb or\r\nvalgrind output), and perhaps a network trace.  Vague queries or piecemeal \r\nmessages are difficult to act upon and don't help the development effort.\r\n\r\nAdditional information can be found at the project's manual.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATCHES\r\n-------\r\nPatches are welcome and encouraged. Patches can be submitted through the \r\nbug tracking system or the mailing list.  When submitting patches, please \r\nbe sure to use sources from the git repository, and preferrably from the \r\nmaster branch.  To create a patch for the project from a local git repository, \r\nplease use the following commands. 'gnutls' should be the local directory \r\nof a previous git clone.\r\n\r\n    cd gnutls\r\n    git add the-file-you-modified.c another-file.c\r\n    git commit the-file-you-modified.c another-file.c\r\n    git format-patch\r\n\r\nFor more information on use of Git, visit http://git-scm.com/\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCopying and distribution of this file, with or without modification,\r\nare permitted in any medium without royalty provided the copyright\r\nnotice and this notice are preserved.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
